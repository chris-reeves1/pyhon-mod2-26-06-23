# Exercise 1: Fibonacci Series
# Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number "n" using a for loop.

# Exercise 2: Prime numbers
# Write a program to print all prime numbers within a given range (start and end) using a for loop.

# Exercise 3: Perfect Numbers
# Write a program to find all perfect numbers within a given range (start and end) using a for loop.
# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. ie 6 has proper
# divisors of 1, 2 and 3 (not 5 or 6), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. 8 has proper divisors of 1, 2
# and 4. 1 + 2 + 4 is 7, so 8 is not a perfect number. 

# Exercise 4 : Multiplication Table
# Write a program to generate the multiplication table for a 
# given number (n) up to a certain limit (limit) using a for loop.
