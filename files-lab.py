import csv

companies = []
sales = []

with open..... as ...:
    read with csv.reader(alias)
    next() - can skip over first line
    for loop to iterate through each line:
        append to companies
        append to sales

monthly sum = [list comprehension - use zip(*sales) - to unpack data] 

yearly_sum = {}
for loop to add companies as keys and sum of sales to values
    
figure out a nice way to print out the results
